# Blood-Donation-Prediction-using-R-Data Challenge
This is a data competition to predict whether a student, who donated blood in the March 2007, will donate again or not, if the camps are set up using various machine learning techniques in R.

This project has been completed by extracting dataset on historical blood donations from datadriven.org site.
