# Blood-Donation-Prediction
This is a data competition to predict whether a student, who donated blood in the March 2007, will donate again or not, if the camps are set up using various machine learning techniques.

Here are the steps performed for this project:

• Performed statistical analysis on the data set related to blood donations provided by drivendata.org using R 

• Conducted data exploration, data preprocessing and applied feature engineering methods.

• Successfully built predictive models using machine learning algorithms like Decision Trees, Random Forest.

• Performed parameter optimization and ensemble models to minimize log loss.
